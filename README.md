IndoorNav
=========

Example app using the iBeacon API of iOS 7
- The app can simulate two different beacons (hence you will need 3 iOS devices in this case)
- Ranging beacon view: different things appearing on the screen depending on which beacon is the nearest one and upon its distance
- Ability to change the beacon data (UUID, major and minor numbers) from the iOS system preferences (e.g. for using the app with real BLE beacons, limitations: the two beacons must share the same UUID and major number)
